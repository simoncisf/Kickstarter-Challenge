# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to understand trends that our client Louise is interested in. 

Given Louise's interest in kickstarter campaigns in the theater category, we perform a specific analysis of campaigns in that category for the US and Great Britain regions separately.

The image below shows the outcomes of kickstarter campaigns in the US based on the start date of the campaigns.

What this chart tells us is that starting a campagign around the months of May and June will make the campaign more likely to succeed. Louise should take this into account when starting her own campaign. 

Another analysis Louise was interested in was a breakdown all the parent categories and understanding which of those paretn categories were most successful specifically in the Great Britain region. The chart below shows this analysis.

As seen in the chart, the most successful campaigns were music Kickstarters, followed by theater and film/video ones. This is a good indication that theater Kickstarters are generally successful and Louise should be encouraged by this conclusion to move forward with her project.
